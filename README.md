## Setting up the development environment


## Run

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) for Android Apps and [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for iOS apps along withg [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) installed to build apps.

After downloading source code, unpacking it, then run:
```bash
npm install 
```
Then you can already try to run Andoid app with the following commands (Android emulator must be already running):
```bash
npm start or expo start
```
This will start a development server for you.

## Running your React Native application

Install the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, use the built-in QR code scanner of the default iOS Camera app.
